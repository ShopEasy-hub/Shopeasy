## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Used

**Delete Operations:**
- `DELETE /org/${orgId}/stock/all` - Deletes all stock entries
- `DELETE /org/${orgId}/inventory/all` - Deletes all inventory records

**Read Operations:**
- `GET /org/${orgId}/products` - Fetches products
- `GET /stock/${branchId}` - Fetches stock for branch

### State Management

The page tracks:
- `checks` - Array of diagnostic results
- `loading` - Loading state for checks
- `lastChecked` - Timestamp of last run
- `showDeleteDialog` - Delete confirmation visibility
- `deleting` - Deletion in progress state

### Error Handling

- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- Detailed error messages in console
- User-friendly alerts
- Automatic status updates after actions

## What This Solves

### Root Cause
Your Supabase `kv_store_088c2cd9` table has RLS enabled but no policies, blocking data access.

### Why It Happens
Supabase security model:
- RLS ON + No Policies = Nothing works ❌
- RLS OFF = Works but insecure ⚠️
- RLS ON + Correct Policies = Works securely ✅

### The Fix
SQL script creates proper policies so authenticated users (your app) and service role (backend) can access data.

### Why Delete Stock?
- Corrupted data might have wrong format
- Duplicate entries might exist
- Starting fresh ensures clean state
- Only takes seconds to recreate

## Success Metrics

After completing the fix, you should see:

**Database Status Page:**
- ✅ 5/5 checks passing (all green)
- ✅ "ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL" in console
- ✅ Last checked timestamp updates on refresh

**Inventory Page:**
- ✅ Products show correct stock quantities
- ✅ Can create products with initial stock
- ✅ Can adjust stock levels
- ✅ Can delete products without errors

**POS Page:**

**Transfers Page:**
- ✅ Shows available stock for products
- ✅ Can create transfers
- ✅ No "no stock available" errors

**Short Dated Page:**

## Question 2: Does the previous SQL match the corrections?

### **Answer: NO - Use Different SQL** ❌

### **❌ DON'T USE:**
```
/CRITICAL_FIX_RUN_THIS_SQL.sql
```

**Why?**
- This was for the **OLD KV store** system
- You've **migrated to PostgreSQL** with proper tables
- It's **completely outdated**

---

### **✅ USE THIS INSTEAD:**
```
/supabase/migrations/HYBRID_MIGRATION.sql
```

**Why?**
- ✅ Creates **modern database** with proper tables
- ✅ Matches the **new architecture** 
- ✅ Includes **automatic triggers**
- ✅ Prevents **duplicate stock**
- ✅ Works with **new Supabase client** we just fixed
- ✅ **Preserves existing data**

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "Table kv_store_088c2cd9 not found"
✅ **Solution**: This is expected! That table no longer exists. Run the migration SQL to create new tables.

### "No data showing up"
✅ **Solution**: 
1. Check RLS policies are set (migration does this)
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Check browser console for errors

### "Stock not syncing"
✅ **Solution**: Database triggers handle sync automatically. Ensure migration ran successfully.

### "Can't upload supplier invoice"
✅ **Solution**: Storage bucket is created by migration. Check Supabase Storage dashboard.

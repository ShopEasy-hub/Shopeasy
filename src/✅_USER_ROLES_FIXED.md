# ✅ User Role Selection Fixed

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

**Problem:** When adding users, only "cashier" role was visible or selectable.

**Root Cause:** The native HTML `<select>` element had rendering/styling issues that prevented all role options from displaying properly, especially on mobile devices.

**Solution:** Replaced native HTML select with the proper UI Select component for consistent cross-platform rendering.

## 🔍 How to Verify It Worked

After running the migration, you should see these numbers:

```
Unique Constraint: 1 (expected: 1)
Indexes: 2 (expected: 2)
RLS Policies: 4 (expected: 4)
Upsert Function: 1 (expected: 1)
```

If you see **different numbers**, copy the output and tell me.

## ❌ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Function Exists
Run this in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'upsert_inventory_safe';
```
**Expected:** 1 row returned with "upsert_inventory_safe"

### Check 2: Try Manual Call
```sql
SELECT * FROM upsert_inventory_safe(
    (SELECT id FROM organizations LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT id FROM products LIMIT 1),
    100,
    (SELECT id FROM branches LIMIT 1),
    NULL,
    NULL
);
```
**Expected:** Returns 1 inventory record

### Check 3: Browser Console
Press F12, look for:
```
✅ Sale completed successfully
📄 Receipt data prepared
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If after running COMPLETE_FIX_V3_CORRECTED.sql you still have problems:

**Tell me:**
1. Did the migration complete? (Yes/No)
2. Did you see "ALL CHECKS PASSED"? (Yes/No)
3. What are the verification numbers? (Constraint: ?, Indexes: ?, etc.)
4. What error appears in browser console? (Copy exact text)
5. Which test fails? (POS/Transfer/Warehouse)

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Migration ran without SQL errors
- [ ] Saw "ALL CHECKS PASSED" message
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser
- [ ] POS sale shows receipt

## 💡 Key Difference From Before

**Old SQL (BROKEN):**
```sql
EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_key THEN  -- ❌ Invalid exception name
```

**New SQL (FIXED):**
```sql
EXCEPTION 
    WHEN unique_violation THEN     -- ✅ Valid exception name
    WHEN duplicate_table THEN      -- ✅ Valid exception name
    WHEN OTHERS THEN               -- ✅ Catch-all
```
